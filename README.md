# How to play the game

Your player will start toward the bottom of the arena. Your goal is to get the player to the water across the road where the beetles are crossing. You must do this without getting hit by any of the beetles. If you manage to get across the road, you will win points and start at the initial starting point. You must continue to do this until you win 100+ points. If you manage to get his, you lost 5 points and start over again. 

To move the player, use the arrow keys on your keyboard. You can move in all directions, but not diagonal, sorry!
